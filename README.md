# About Me: ðŸ“‘
I'm a JR software developer from MÃ©xico.
Recently graduated at informatics engineering, I'm excited to begin my career as a software developer.  I'm a quick learner in challenging environments that require me to think critically. While I don't have any professional experience in the field, I have completed projects that have allowed me to develop my skills and gain practical experience. I'm confident that my education and personal projects have prepared me for a successful career as a software developer.
I'm excited about the opportunity to join a dynamic company where I can continue to learn and grow as a developer.
